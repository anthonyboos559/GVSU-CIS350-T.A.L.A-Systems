# T.A.L.A Systems

This project is meant to model the database that a grocery store may have stored. The database holds a member table, an employee table, and an inventory table. The member table has information on customers who have this grocery stores membership, the employee table has information on the employees that work at the grocery store, the inventory table holds information about various products the store has.
A Python GUI is the interface the users uses to interact with the program. The GUI will allow the user to select the information that they want and also allow them to edit the information, add information/data, and delete information/data.
